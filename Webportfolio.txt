This website is a personal portfolio that I plan to update as time goes on. This was my first time ever creating a website or working in HTML, and I had a lot of during the process. I plan to clean up the design a little bit, because that was what I struggled with the most. Currently, my work is centered around my brother Kai who has special needs, and I think for the most part a lot of my future projects will be focused on raising awareness for people with special needs.
